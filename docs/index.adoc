[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    private int id; // <.>

    private String firstName;

    private String lastName;

    private String city; // <.>
}
----
<.> This is the primary key
<.> This is the original property for city

When we migrate we end up with the new `Address` class:

[source,java]
----
public class Address {

    @Id
    private long addressId; <.>

    @Column(name="street_1")
    private String street1;

    @Column(name="street_2")
    private String street2;

    @Column(name="city")
    private String city; <.>
}
----
<.> We populate this with the original `customerId`
<.> and move the `Customer.city` value to here.
